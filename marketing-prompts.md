## SECTION 1: CONTENT STRATEGY (Prompts 1-10)

---

### Prompt 1: Quarterly Content Calendar with Pillar-Cluster Architecture

```
You are a senior content strategist with 15 years of experience in {industry}.

Requirements:
1. Define 3-4 content pillars that align with our business goals
2. For each pillar, create a topic cluster with 1 pillar page and 6-8 cluster articles
3. Map each piece of content to a specific stage of the buyer journey (Awareness, Consideration, Decision)
4. Include content repurposing chains (e.g., blog -> social carousel -> email -> video script)
5. Flag 5 "tentpole" content pieces that require extra production effort but drive outsized results
6. Include seasonal hooks, industry events, and trending topic slots
7. Assign a primary KPI to each content piece (traffic, leads, engagement, conversions)

Output Format:
- Month-by-month breakdown in a table: Week | Content Title | Pillar | Format | Channel | Buyer Stage | KPI | Repurposing Chain
- Executive summary paragraph explaining the strategic rationale
- Content production timeline with deadlines and dependencies
```

**Tip:** Feed the AI your Google Analytics top pages and Search Console queries first. The more real data you provide about what already works, the sharper the calendar will be.

3. ACTION PLAN:
   - Content to UPDATE (high-potential existing pieces)
   - Content to CONSOLIDATE (thin/duplicate pages to merge)
   - Content to CREATE (net-new pieces filling gaps)
   - Content to RETIRE (outdated, off-brand, or cannibalizing)

Output Format:
- Scoring matrix table
- Gap analysis summary with prioritized opportunities
- 30-day action plan with specific tasks ranked by impact/effort
```

Channels we're active on: {channel_list}
Team members available for repurposing: {team_description}
Tools we use: {tools, e.g., "Canva, Descript, Buffer, WordPress"}

For ONE piece of primary content, build a complete repurposing cascade:

1. DERIVATIVE CONTENT MAP:

Industry: {industry}
Current brand perception: {how_audience_sees_us}
Desired brand perception: {how_we_want_to_be_seen}

Sample content that represents our best current voice:
{paste_3_to_5_examples_of_existing_content_you_like}

Build a complete voice guide with:

1. VOICE ATTRIBUTES (pick 4):
   - For each: definition, "this but not that" spectrum, real examples
   - Example: "Confident but not Arrogant" — [examples of each]

### Prompt 8: Content Scoring Model

```
You are a marketing analytics specialist. Build a custom content scoring model for {brand_name} to evaluate and prioritize content ideas before production.

Business model: {business_model, e.g., "B2B SaaS, self-serve trial to paid conversion"}
Average customer lifetime value: {LTV}
Primary conversion action: {conversion_action, e.g., "free trial signup", "demo request"}
Content team capacity: {pieces_per_month} pieces per month
Biggest content challenge: {challenge, e.g., "lots of traffic but low conversion", "small audience but high intent"}

Build a scoring model with:

1. SCORING CRITERIA (weighted):
   - Search demand (monthly search volume, trend direction)
   - Business alignment (proximity to our product/solution)
   - Competition difficulty (content saturation, domain authority of rankers)
   - Conversion potential (buyer intent level of the topic)
   - Production effort (research, expertise, multimedia required)
   - Differentiation opportunity (can we add unique value?)
   - Repurposing potential (how many derivatives can this produce?)
   Assign weights (total = 100%) based on our business model.

2. SCORING RUBRIC:
   - For each criterion, define what a 1, 3, and 5 score looks like
   - Include specific examples relevant to our industry

3. PRIORITIZATION MATRIX:
   - Plot scored ideas on an Impact vs. Effort 2x2 grid
   - Define thresholds for "Publish immediately", "Schedule for next quarter", "Backlog", "Kill"

4. EXAMPLE APPLICATION:
   - Score these 10 content ideas using the model:
   {list_10_content_ideas_you_are_considering}

Output Format:
- Scoring model documentation with formulas
- Rubric reference sheet (printable)
- Scored content ideas in a ranked table
- Recommendation summary: what to publish first and why
```

**Tip:** Be honest about your biggest challenge. If you say "lots of traffic, low conversion," the model will weight business alignment and conversion potential higher, which is exactly what you need.

   - Visual assets needed (screenshots, diagrams, charts)
   - CTA placement and copy

Output Format: Complete brief document ready to hand to a writer, with all sections filled in and specific guidance (not vague instructions).
```

**Tip:** Always include competitor URLs. The AI will analyze what they cover and find gaps, making your brief infinitely more actionable than a blank-slate approach.

### Prompt 10: Content ROI Forecasting Model

```
You are a marketing finance analyst. Build a content ROI forecasting model for {brand_name} to justify content investment to leadership.

Current metrics:
- Monthly organic traffic: {organic_traffic}
- Average conversion rate from content: {conversion_rate}
- Average deal size / customer value: {average_value}
- Current content production cost per piece: {cost_per_piece}
- Monthly content output: {pieces_per_month}
- Average time to rank (new content): {months_to_rank}
- Content lifespan (months of useful traffic): {content_lifespan}

Build a model that:

1. CALCULATES CURRENT CONTENT ROI:
   - Cost per content-attributed lead
   - Cost per content-attributed customer
   - Revenue generated per content piece (lifetime)
   - Overall content program ROI percentage

2. FORECASTS GROWTH SCENARIOS:
   - Scenario A: Maintain current investment
   - Scenario B: Increase investment by 50%
   - Scenario C: Double investment
   - For each: projected traffic, leads, revenue, ROI at 6 and 12 months

3. IDENTIFIES LEVERAGE POINTS:
   - Where a small improvement yields outsized returns
   - E.g., "Improving conversion rate from 2% to 3% is worth more than doubling traffic"
   - Rank the top 5 optimization levers by impact

4. CREATES EXECUTIVE DASHBOARD:
   - 5-7 metrics leadership should track monthly
   - Benchmarks for each metric (industry standard vs. our target)
   - Traffic light system (red/yellow/green thresholds)

5. BUILDS THE BUSINESS CASE:
   - One-page executive summary arguing for {requested_budget}
   - Comparison to paid advertising costs for equivalent results
   - Compounding value argument (content as appreciating asset)

Output Format:
- Financial model with all calculations shown
- Three scenario comparison table
- Executive summary document (one page)
- Monthly dashboard template
```

**Tip:** If you don't have exact metrics, use reasonable estimates and note them as assumptions. An imperfect model is infinitely better than no model. Leadership responds to numbers, even directional ones.

---

### Prompt 21: Welcome Email Sequence (7-Part)

```

Primary CTA for the sequence: {desired_action, e.g., "complete onboarding", "make first purchase", "book a demo"}
Target audience: {audience}
Brand voice: {voice, e.g., "friendly expert", "bold innovator", "warm mentor"}
Average time from signup to first purchase: {conversion_timeline}

Important: The subscriber signed up via: {signup_source, e.g., "lead magnet download", "free trial", "newsletter opt-in"}

Create 7 emails with specific timing:

EMAIL 1 — Immediate (Welcome + Quick Win):
EMAIL 2 — Day 2 (Value Delivery + Brand Story):
EMAIL 3 — Day 4 (Social Proof + Credibility):
EMAIL 4 — Day 7 (Deeper Education + Engagement):
EMAIL 5 — Day 10 (Soft Pitch + Incentive):
EMAIL 6 — Day 14 (Objection Handling):
EMAIL 7 — Day 21 (Final Push + Urgency):

For EACH email provide:
- Subject line (2 options: one curiosity-driven, one benefit-driven)
- Preview text (40-90 characters)
- Full email body copy (formatted with headers, short paragraphs, and white space)
- Primary CTA button text and link description
- Secondary CTA (if applicable)
- P.S. line (often the most-read line in an email)

- Metrics to track for sequence health
- Red flags that indicate the sequence needs adjustment

Output Format: Complete email sequence with full copy, logic, and testing plan. Ready to build in any email platform.
```

**Tip:** The signup source context is critical. Someone who downloaded a lead magnet needs different nurturing than someone who started a free trial. Always specify this.

### Prompt 22: Re-engagement Campaign for Dormant Subscribers

```
You are an email deliverability and engagement specialist. Design a re-engagement campaign for {brand_name}'s dormant email subscribers.

Context:

- What changed since they were active: {changes, e.g., "new product features", "pricing update", "brand refresh"}

Build a complete re-engagement campaign:

1. SEGMENTATION STRATEGY:
   - Define dormancy tiers (30 days, 60 days, 90 days, 180+ days)
   - Different approaches for each tier
   - Data enrichment opportunities before emailing

2. WIN-BACK SEQUENCE (4 emails over 14 days):

   Email 1 — "We miss you" (emotional reconnection):
   Email 2 — "Here's what you've missed" (value summary):
   Email 3 — "Exclusive offer" (incentive to return):
   Email 4 — "Last chance" (sunset warning):

   For each: Subject line (3 options), preview text, full copy, CTA

3. INCENTIVE STRATEGY:
   - What to offer at each stage (content, discount, access, etc.)
   - Cost-benefit analysis of incentive options
   - "Ethical bribe" approach (valuable without undermining pricing)

4. SUNSET POLICY:
   - When to remove non-responders from the list

### Prompt 23: Product Launch Email Sequence

```
You are an email copywriter who has written launch sequences generating $1M+ in revenue. Create a product launch email sequence for {brand_name}.

Launch details:
- Product name: {product_name}

- Price: {price} (launch price: {launch_price} if different)
- Launch date: {launch_date}
- Pre-launch list size: {list_size}
- Target revenue goal: {revenue_target}
- Launch urgency lever: {scarcity, e.g., "limited spots", "early bird pricing", "bonus expires", "founding member perks"}

Customer context:
- Primary pain point this solves: {pain_point}
- Main competing alternatives: {alternatives}
- Why our solution is different: {differentiator}
- Ideal customer profile: {icp}

Create a 10-email launch sequence across 3 phases:

PHASE 1: PRE-LAUNCH (4 emails, 7 days before launch):
- Email 1: Seed the problem (make them feel the pain)
- Email 2: Tease the solution (without revealing the product)
- Email 3: Behind-the-scenes story (why we built this)
- Email 4: Early access announcement (waitlist or VIP preview)

PHASE 2: LAUNCH (4 emails, launch day through day 3):
- Email 5: Launch announcement (doors open)
- Email 6: Social proof + FAQ (testimonials, handle objections)
- Email 7: Deep dive (one killer feature explored in detail)

```

**Tip:** The pre-launch phase is where money is made. Most people skip it. If you only have time to refine 4 emails, make it the pre-launch ones. By launch day, your audience should already want the product before knowing exactly what it is.

---

### Prompt 24: Abandoned Cart Recovery Sequence

```
You are a conversion optimization specialist for e-commerce email. Build an abandoned cart recovery sequence for {brand_name}.

Store details:
- Product category: {category}
- Average order value: {aov}
- Current cart abandonment rate: {abandonment_rate}
- Current recovery rate: {recovery_rate}
- Typical customer objections: {objections, e.g., "price too high", "shipping costs", "comparing alternatives", "need to think about it"}
- Return/refund policy: {policy}

Create a 4-email recovery sequence:

EMAIL 1 — 1 hour after abandonment (Gentle Reminder):
- Tone: Helpful, not pushy. "You left something behind."
- Include cart contents with images
- Address the #1 objection: {primary_objection}
- Social proof element

EMAIL 2 — 24 hours (Value Reinforcement):
- Tone: Educational. Why this product matters.

- Clear deadline

For EACH email:
- Subject line (3 options)
- Preview text
- Full HTML email structure description (layout, images, CTAs)
- Complete copy

ALSO:

- SMS integration touchpoints
- Exit-intent popup copy (prevent abandonment before it happens)
- Revenue recovery projection

Output Format: Complete 4-email sequence with copy, design direction, segmentation rules, and projections.
```

**Tip:** Email 1 should not include a discount. Offering a discount immediately trains customers to abandon carts for coupons. Save incentives for Email 3, and only for first-time abandoners.

### Prompt 25: Newsletter Monetization Strategy

```
You are a newsletter business strategist. Design a monetization strategy for {newsletter_name}.

Newsletter details:

You are a list building strategist. Design a comprehensive email list growth strategy for {brand_name}.

Current state:

- Industry: {industry}
- Target audience: {audience}

### Prompt 27: Email A/B Testing Program

```
You are an email optimization specialist who runs systematic A/B testing programs. Design a 12-week testing program for {brand_name}'s email marketing.

Current email metrics:
- List size: {list_size}
- Average open rate: {open_rate}
- Average click rate: {click_rate}
- Average conversion rate: {conversion_rate}
- Sending frequency: {frequency}
- Email platform: {platform, e.g., "Mailchimp", "Klaviyo", "ConvertKit"}

Build a structured testing program:

1. TESTING FOUNDATION:
   - Minimum sample size calculations for our list size
   - Statistical significance thresholds
   - How long to run each test
   - How to isolate variables properly
   - Documentation template for each test

2. 12-WEEK TESTING ROADMAP:
   Week 1-4 (Subject Lines):
   - Test 1: Length (short vs. long)
   - Test 2: Personalization (name vs. no name)
   - Test 3: Emoji (with vs. without)
   - Test 4: Format (question vs. statement vs. number)

   Week 5-8 (Email Content):
   - Test 5: Length (200 words vs. 500 words)
   - Test 6: Image (with vs. without)
   - Test 7: CTA placement (top vs. bottom vs. both)

   - Minimum runtime
   - Expected impact if hypothesis is correct

4. ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:
   - How to read and interpret results
   - When a result is "significant" vs. "noise"
   - How to document and apply learnings

   - 5 advanced tests to run next quarter
   - Multivariate testing approach
   - Segmented testing strategy

Output Format: Complete 12-week program with specific test designs, hypothesis documentation, and analysis templates.
```

**Tip:** Resist the urge to test everything at once. Sequential testing with clear documentation compounds gains. A 5% improvement on open rate + 5% on click rate + 5% on conversion = 15.8% more revenue (multiplicative, not additive).

### Prompt 28: Email Segmentation Architecture

```
You are an email marketing automation architect. Design a comprehensive segmentation strategy for {brand_name}.

Business context:
- Business model: {model, e.g., "B2B SaaS", "e-commerce", "service business"}

- Email platform: {platform}
- Current segmentation: {current_approach, e.g., "basic: new vs. existing customers"}

Build a segmentation architecture:

1. SEGMENT DEFINITIONS:
   Define 10-15 segments based on:
   - Behavioral (website visits, email engagement, purchase patterns)
   - Lifecycle (where they are in the customer journey)
   - Value (spending level, potential value)
   - Interest (content preferences, product categories)
   For each segment: definition, size estimate, value level, content needs

   - Lead scoring model (points system)
   - Trigger-based email workflows (minimum 5 workflows)
   - Segment migration rules (when someone moves from one segment to another)
   - Win-back triggers (when to activate re-engagement)
   - VIP identification and treatment

4. PERSONALIZATION FRAMEWORK:
   - Dynamic content blocks by segment
   - Personalized product recommendations logic
   - Send time optimization by segment

```

**Tip:** If you are on Shopify or a platform with built-in email attribution, export that data and include it. Even imperfect attribution data is better than guessing. The model can always be refined.

### Prompt 33: YouTube Ad Script Generator

```
You are a direct response video copywriter. Write YouTube ad scripts for {brand_name}.

Product/service: {product_description}

- SOLUTION (15-25s): Introduce the product as the answer.
- CTA (25-30s): Clear, urgent next step.

SCRIPT 2 — Testimonial/Story (60 seconds):

Output Format: Production-ready scripts with complete visual and audio direction.
```

**Tip:** The first 5 seconds determine everything. Write 10 different hooks for each script and pick the most surprising one. On YouTube, you are competing with the "Skip" button, not other ads.

---

### Prompt 34: LinkedIn Ad Campaign Suite

```
You are a B2B advertising strategist specializing in LinkedIn. Create a full LinkedIn ad campaign for {brand_name}.

Business:
- B2B product/service: {product_description}
- Target decision-maker: {title_and_seniority, e.g., "VP of Marketing at B2B SaaS companies, 50-500 employees"}
- Industry targeting: {industries}
- Geographic targeting: {geo}
- Monthly budget: {budget}
- Campaign goal: {goal, e.g., "generate demo requests", "drive whitepaper downloads"}

Create a multi-format campaign:

1. SPONSORED CONTENT (3 ads):
   - Single image ad (with headline, intro text, description, CTA)
   - Carousel ad (5 cards, each with headline and description)
   - Video ad (15-30 second script + thumbnail)
   For each: copy targeting the specific decision-maker's priorities

2. SPONSORED MESSAGING (2 versions):
   - Message Ad: Subject line + body (under 500 characters) + CTA button
   - Conversation Ad: Branching flow with 3 CTA options
   Both: personalized, not salesy, leading with value

3. TEXT ADS (5 variations):

   - Image direction

6. BUDGET ALLOCATION:

   - Optimization schedule (when to review and adjust)

Output Format: Complete campaign brief with all ad copy, audience definitions, budget allocation, and optimization plan.
```

**Tip:** LinkedIn's audience is smaller and more expensive than Meta. Compensate by making your value proposition hyper-specific to the job title. "VP of Marketing" responds to different messaging than "Director of Demand Gen" even if they are the same person.

---

### Prompt 35: Retargeting Ad Sequence

```
You are a retargeting specialist. Design a retargeting ad sequence for {brand_name} that converts website visitors into customers.

Website details:
- Monthly visitors: {monthly_visitors}
- Conversion rate: {conversion_rate}
- Average time to convert: {days_to_convert}
- Key pages: {important_pages, e.g., "homepage, pricing page, demo page, blog"}
- Product/service: {product_description}
- Price point: {price}

Design a retargeting sequence:

1. AUDIENCE SEGMENTS (by behavior):
   - Homepage visitors (but didn't go deeper)
   - Product/pricing page viewers (high intent, didn't convert)
   - Blog readers (interested in topic, not yet product-aware)
   - Cart/form abandoners (highest intent)
   - Past customers (upsell/cross-sell)
   For each: estimated size, value score, message strategy

2. AD SEQUENCE BY SEGMENT (each segment gets a 3-ad sequence):

   Ad 1 (Day 1-3): [Immediate retarget]
   - Purpose: Remind and reinforce value
   - Creative approach and copy

   Ad 2 (Day 4-7): [Value add]
   - Purpose: Educate and build trust
   - Creative approach and copy

   Ad 3 (Day 8-14): [Conversion push]
   - Purpose: Incentivize and overcome objections
   - Creative approach and copy

3. CREATIVE SPECIFICATIONS:
   For each ad in each segment:
   - Primary text
   - Headline
   - Visual direction
   - CTA
   - Platform-specific format (feed, stories, display network)

4. FREQUENCY AND EXCLUSION RULES:
   - Maximum impressions per person per day
   - Burn pixel strategy (stop showing ads after conversion)
   - Audience refresh windows
   - Cross-platform frequency capping

5. MEASUREMENT:
   - Attribution window recommendation
   - View-through vs. click-through tracking
   - Incrementality testing approach
   - ROAS targets by segment

Output Format: Complete retargeting blueprint with audience definitions, full ad copy for every sequence step, and measurement framework.
```

**Tip:** The pricing page visitor segment is your highest-ROI retargeting audience. They already know your product, checked the price, and left. Write your best ad for this segment first. A 5% conversion from this segment often pays for the entire retargeting budget.

---

### Prompt 36: Landing Page Copy Framework

```
You are a conversion copywriter who has written landing pages with 10%+ conversion rates. Write complete landing page copy for {brand_name}.

Product/service: {product_description}
Price: {price}
Target audience: {audience}
Primary traffic source: {traffic_source, e.g., "Google Ads", "Facebook Ads", "organic search"}
Desired action: {cta_action, e.g., "start free trial", "book demo", "buy now"}
Key proof points: {proof_points, e.g., "500+ customers", "4.8 star rating", "featured in Forbes"}
Main objections: {top_3_objections}

Write complete copy for each section:

1. HERO SECTION:
   - Headline (3 options: benefit-driven, curiosity-driven, pain-driven)
   - Subheadline (supporting the headline with specifics)
   - Hero CTA button text (3 options)
   - Social proof element (e.g., "Trusted by 500+ companies")
   - Visual direction

2. PROBLEM SECTION:
   - Section headline
   - 3 pain points with vivid, specific descriptions
   - Agitation paragraph (make them feel the cost of NOT solving this)

3. SOLUTION SECTION:
   - Transition from problem to solution
   - Product introduction (what it is, in one sentence)
   - 3-4 key features, each framed as a benefit
   - Visual: screenshot, demo, or illustration direction

4. SOCIAL PROOF SECTION:
   - 3 testimonial templates (with guidance on what to ask customers)
   - Case study summary format
   - Logo bar direction
   - Statistics/metrics display

5. HOW IT WORKS:
   - 3-step process (simplify the complex)
   - Each step: icon concept, headline, description

6. PRICING/OFFER SECTION:
   - Offer framing (value stack)
   - Price presentation
   - Guarantee/risk reversal
   - CTA with urgency

7. FAQ SECTION:
   - 6-8 questions and answers (addressing real objections)

8. FINAL CTA:
   - Closing headline (different from hero)
   - Final persuasion paragraph
   - CTA button
   - Last piece of social proof

Output Format: Complete landing page copy, section by section, with wireframe direction notes. Ready to hand to a designer or build in any page builder.
```

**Tip:** Match the hero headline to the ad that drives traffic. If your ad says "Cut your meeting time by 50%," your landing page headline should echo that exact promise. Message mismatch is the #1 landing page conversion killer.

---

### Prompt 37: Google Display Network Ad Copy

```
You are a display advertising specialist. Create a complete GDN ad set for {brand_name}.

Product/service: {product_description}
Target audience: {audience}
Campaign objective: {objective}
Key benefit: {primary_benefit}
Brand colors: {colors}
Competitor differentiation: {what_makes_us_different}

Create copy for all standard GDN sizes:

1. RESPONSIVE DISPLAY AD:
   - Short headlines (5 options, max 30 characters each)
   - Long headline (1, max 90 characters)
   - Descriptions (5 options, max 90 characters each)
   - Business name
   - CTA options (3)
   - Image direction (landscape 1200x628, square 1200x1200, logo)

2. STATIC BANNER ADS (copy + layout direction for each):
   - Leaderboard (728x90)
   - Medium Rectangle (300x250)
   - Wide Skyscraper (160x600)

   - Affinity audiences: {relevant_affinity_segments}
   - Custom intent audiences: keyword list for targeting
   - Remarketing: specific messaging for return visitors

Output Format: Complete ad copy document organized by format and variant, with visual direction for each size.
```

**Tip:** Display ads have ~0.1 seconds to communicate. Simplify ruthlessly. One benefit, one visual, one CTA. If you cannot read your banner ad from 3 feet away from your monitor, it is too complex.

---

### Prompt 38: A/B Test Copy Variations Generator

```
You are a conversion optimization specialist. Generate systematic A/B test copy variations for {brand_name}'s {asset_type, e.g., "landing page", "ad campaign", "email"}.

Current copy that we're testing against (control):
{paste_current_copy}

Conversion metric: {metric, e.g., "click-through rate", "signup rate", "purchase rate"}
Current conversion rate: {current_rate}
Target improvement: {target_improvement, e.g., "15% lift"}
Audience: {audience}

Generate variations testing these elements:

1. HEADLINE TESTS (5 variations):
   - Variation A: Change the emotional angle (fear -> aspiration)
   - Variation B: Add specificity (numbers, timeframes, results)
   - Variation C: Reframe as a question
   - Variation D: Lead with social proof
   - Variation E: Use a contrarian/surprising angle
   For each: the copy, the hypothesis, what makes it different from control

2. CTA TESTS (5 variations):
   - Variation A: Action-oriented ("Start saving" vs. "Sign up")
   - Variation B: First-person ("Get MY free report" vs. "Get your free report")
   - Variation C: Add urgency ("Start free trial — 14 days left")
   - Variation D: Reduce friction ("See it in action" vs. "Book a demo")
   - Variation E: Value-focused ("Unlock your dashboard" vs. "Create account")

3. BODY COPY TESTS (3 variations):
   - Variation A: Shorter (cut by 50%)
   - Variation B: More social proof emphasis
   - Variation C: Different structure (bullet points vs. paragraphs, or vice versa)

4. TEST PRIORITY RANKING:
   - Rank all variations by expected impact
   - Recommended testing sequence (test highest-impact first)
   - Sample size and duration requirements for each test
   - How to handle the winner (iterate further or move to next element)

Output Format: Complete testing plan with all copy variations, hypotheses, and implementation sequence.
```

**Tip:** Test big changes first. Changing a headline from benefit-focused to pain-focused is a big test. Changing "Get" to "Start" is a small test. Big tests produce big learnings. Save micro-optimizations for later.

---

### Prompt 39: Multi-Channel Ad Campaign Orchestration

```
You are a media strategist orchestrating a multi-channel advertising campaign. Design a coordinated campaign for {brand_name}.

Campaign overview:

- Product/offer: {product_description}
- Total budget: {total_budget}
- Campaign duration: {duration}
- Primary goal: {goal}
- Target audience: {audience}
- Geographic focus: {geography}

Channels to include:
{list_channels, e.g., "Google Search, Google Display, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, TikTok, Email"}

Design the orchestrated campaign:

1. CHANNEL ROLE ASSIGNMENT:
   - For each channel: primary role (awareness, consideration, conversion, retention)
   - Customer journey mapping (which channel serves which stage)
   - Budget allocation percentage per channel with reasoning
   - Expected CPL/CPA per channel

2. MESSAGING FRAMEWORK:
   - Core message (the ONE thing we want people to remember)
   - Channel-specific message adaptation:
     * How the message adapts for each platform
     * Tone shift per platform
     * Creative format per platform
   - Messaging sequence across channels (what they see first, second, third)

3. TIMING AND FLIGHT PLAN:
   - Campaign phases (pre-launch, launch, sustain, close)
   - Channel activation timeline (not all channels launch simultaneously)
   - Daily budget pacing
   - Key milestones and checkpoints

4. CROSS-CHANNEL AUDIENCE STRATEGY:
   - How audiences flow between channels
   - Retargeting waterfalls (e.g., YouTube viewer -> Facebook retarget -> Google search capture)
   - Suppression lists (don't advertise to converters)
   - Lookalike/similar audience expansion plan

5. CREATIVE PRODUCTION PLAN:
   - Total assets needed per channel
   - Production priority order
   - Shared vs. channel-specific creative
   - Creative refresh schedule

6. MEASUREMENT:

   - Mid-campaign decision framework (when to shift budget between channels)

Output Format: Complete campaign orchestration document with budget tables, creative matrix, timeline, and measurement plan.
```

**Tip:** Start with 2-3 channels maximum and add more as you find what works. Every channel you add increases complexity and management overhead. Better to dominate two channels than be mediocre across six.

### Prompt 40: Ad Creative Fatigue Refresh

```
You are a creative strategist tasked with refreshing fatigued ad creatives. Analyze and revitalize {brand_name}'s ad performance.

Current situation:
- Ad platform: {platform}
- Current best-performing ad (describe or paste copy): {current_ad}

- Audience size: {audience_size}
- Frequency: {current_frequency, e.g., "average person has seen ad 8.3 times"}
- What we've already tried: {previous_refreshes}
- Budget: {budget}

Diagnose and refresh:

1. FATIGUE DIAGNOSIS:
   - Root cause analysis (creative fatigue vs. audience saturation vs. market shift)
   - Which element is fatigued (visual, headline, offer, or all of the above)
   - Benchmark comparison (is this normal decay for our spend level?)

2. ITERATION STRATEGY (evolution of current winner):
   - 5 variations that keep the winning formula but feel fresh
   - Each variation changes ONE major element while keeping others
   - Explain what stays the same and what changes

3. NET-NEW CREATIVE ANGLES (breakthrough attempts):
   - 3 completely new creative concepts
   - Different emotional angles than current winner
   - Different formats (if current is image, try video, and vice versa)
   - For each: full copy, visual direction, hypothesis

4. AUDIENCE REFRESH:
   - New audience segments to test existing creative with
   - Lookalike expansion opportunities
   - Interest-based targeting adjustments
   - Exclusion updates

5. TESTING CALENDAR:
   - Week-by-week plan for rolling out refreshed creative
   - How to transition from old to new without losing momentum
   - Budget allocation during testing phase
   - Success metrics and decision criteria

Output Format: Complete creative refresh plan with new ad copy, visual concepts, audience recommendations, and testing timeline.
```

**Tip:** Before creating new ads, test your current winning ad with a new audience. Sometimes the ad is not fatigued -- the audience is. Expanding to a fresh lookalike can revive performance without any creative work.

## SECTION 5: ANALYTICS & REPORTING (Prompts 41-50)

Design a dashboard system:

1. EXECUTIVE DASHBOARD (CEO/C-suite view):

```

**Tip:** Build the executive dashboard first and live with it for two weeks before building the others. You will discover what questions the top-level view generates, and those questions will define what the operational dashboards need to answer.

---

### Prompt 42: Monthly Marketing Report Template

```
You are a marketing reporting specialist. Create a monthly marketing report template for {brand_name} that tells a story, not just presents numbers.

Report audience: {audience, e.g., "CEO and leadership team", "marketing team", "board of directors"}
Business goals this quarter: {goals}
Marketing channels: {channels}
Current reporting challenges: {challenges}

Build a report template with:

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (1 page):

### Prompt 43: Marketing Experiment Framework

```
You are a growth experimentation specialist. Build a structured experimentation framework for {brand_name}'s marketing team.

Team context:
- Marketing team size: {team_size}
- Current experiment velocity: {experiments_per_month, e.g., "2-3 ad hoc tests"}
- Biggest growth lever to test: {growth_lever}

- Risk tolerance: {risk_level, e.g., "moderate — we can test on 10-20% of traffic"}

Build the framework:

1. EXPERIMENT PIPELINE MANAGEMENT:
   - Idea collection process (how team members submit experiment ideas)
   - ICE scoring model customized for our business:
     * Impact: How we estimate potential impact
     * Confidence: How we rate confidence level
     * Ease: How we estimate implementation effort
   - Prioritization process (how we decide what to test)
   - Pipeline template (backlog -> scheduled -> running -> analyzing -> archived)

2. EXPERIMENT DESIGN TEMPLATE:
   Fill-in template for every experiment:
   - Experiment name
   - Owner
   - Hypothesis: "We believe that [change] will [metric] by [amount] because [reasoning]."
   - Primary metric
   - Secondary metrics
   - Guardrail metrics (metrics that must NOT decrease)
   - Sample size calculation
   - Duration estimate
   - Variant descriptions (control vs. treatment)
   - Implementation steps
   - Risk assessment
   - Approval needed (yes/no, from whom)

3. ANALYSIS PROTOCOL:
   - Statistical significance requirements

   - Decision matrix: when to ship, iterate, or kill
   - Post-experiment documentation template
   - Learning extraction process

4. EXPERIMENT IDEAS (20 pre-scored):
   Generate 20 experiment ideas for our business:
   - 5 quick wins (low effort, moderate impact)
   - 5 big bets (high effort, high potential impact)
   - 5 foundational (improve measurement and infrastructure)
   - 5 creative (unconventional approaches)
   Each with: ICE score, hypothesis, expected timeline

5. CULTURE AND PROCESS:
   - Weekly experiment review meeting agenda
   - How to celebrate learnings (not just wins)
   - How to share results across the team
   - Quarterly experimentation review template

Output Format: Complete experimentation playbook with templates, scored idea backlog, and meeting agendas.
```

**Tip:** The hypothesis format is non-negotiable. Every experiment must start with "We believe that [change] will [metric] by [amount] because [reasoning]." Without a hypothesis, you are guessing, not experimenting.

### Prompt 44: Customer Journey Analytics Map

```
You are a customer analytics specialist. Map and analyze the customer journey for {brand_name} using available data.

Business context:
- Product/service: {product_description}
- Business model: {model}
- Average customer lifetime: {lifetime}
- Customer acquisition channels: {channels}
- Key touchpoints: {touchpoints, e.g., "website visit, content download, demo request, trial, purchase, onboarding, support ticket, renewal"}
- CRM/analytics tools: {tools}

Build a journey analytics framework:

1. JOURNEY STAGE DEFINITION:
   - Stage name, entry trigger, exit trigger
   - Key actions at each stage
   - Average time in stage
   - Drop-off rate between stages
   - Dollar value of a customer at each stage

2. TOUCHPOINT ANALYSIS:
   For each major touchpoint:
   - Data available (what we can track)
   - Key metrics to measure
   - Conversion rate to next stage
   - Common paths (sequence analysis)
   - Drop-off analysis (where and why people leave)

3. ATTRIBUTION MODELING:

```

**Tip:** Start by mapping the journey of your last 10 customers who converted. Real paths, not theoretical ones. You will find that actual customer journeys are messier and more interesting than any marketing funnel diagram suggests.

---

### Prompt 45: Marketing Budget Allocation Optimizer

```
You are a marketing finance strategist. Optimize the marketing budget allocation for {brand_name}.

Current budget: {total_monthly_budget}
Revenue target: {revenue_target}
Current allocation:
{For each channel, list: channel name, current spend, current results (leads, customers, revenue)}

Business context:
- Business model: {model}
- Average deal size: {deal_size}
- Customer acquisition cost target: {target_cac}
- Payback period target: {payback_period}
- Growth stage: {stage, e.g., "early growth", "scaling", "mature"}
- Seasonal patterns: {seasonality}

Optimize the budget:

1. CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:
   - ROI by channel (revenue / spend)
   - CAC by channel
   - Contribution margin by channel
   - Efficiency ranking (best to worst performing)
   - Diminishing returns assessment (is any channel over-invested?)

2. REALLOCATION RECOMMENDATION:
   - New budget split with reasoning for each change
   - Expected impact on total leads, customers, and revenue
   - Transition plan (how to shift budget without disrupting performance)
   - Risk assessment for each reallocation

3. SCENARIO MODELING:
   - Scenario A: Optimize current budget (same total, better allocation)
   - Scenario B: 20% budget increase (where to invest the incremental)
   - Scenario C: 20% budget cut (what to cut first)
   - For each: projected results vs. current state

4. MARGINAL RETURN ANALYSIS:
   - For each channel: what does the next $1,000 invested generate?
   - Optimal spend curve (diminishing returns thresholds)
   - Untested channels worth experimenting with (and recommended test budget)

5. QUARTERLY REVIEW FRAMEWORK:
   - Decision criteria for budget shifts
   - Leading indicators that a channel is improving/declining
   - Process for testing new budget allocations
   - Approval workflow for budget changes

Output Format: Reallocation recommendation with data tables, scenario comparisons, and quarterly review framework.
```

**Tip:** Include actual numbers, even rough estimates. "Google Ads: $5,000/month, 50 leads, 5 customers, $25K revenue" gives the AI enough to work with. Precision matters less than having any data at all.

### Prompt 46: Conversion Rate Optimization Audit

```
You are a CRO specialist who has audited 500+ websites. Perform a conversion rate optimization audit for {brand_name}.

Website: {url}
Primary conversion: {conversion_action}
Current conversion rate: {conversion_rate}
Monthly traffic: {traffic}

   - Trust elements present (or missing)
   - Form friction analysis (fields, length, steps)
   - Mobile experience assessment
   - Page speed impact

2. FUNNEL ANALYSIS:
   - Full conversion funnel (page-by-page drop-off)
   - Biggest leak in the funnel (where most people leave)

   - Strategic changes (this quarter, expect 30%+ lift)
   For each recommendation:
   - The problem observed
   - The hypothesis
   - The specific change to make
   - Expected impact (with reasoning)
   - How to test it

   - Compound impact projection (if all tests succeed)

Output Format: Complete CRO audit with prioritized recommendations, test designs, and projected impact.
```

**Tip:** Describe what your landing page looks like section by section, or paste the text content. If you have heatmap data, describe what it shows (e.g., "80% of users scroll past the hero, only 40% reach the pricing section"). Behavioral data transforms this audit from hypothetical to surgical.

---

### Prompt 47: Marketing Attribution Analysis

```
You are a marketing measurement specialist. Build a marketing attribution analysis for {brand_name}.

Data available:
{Describe or paste your conversion data, including:
- Conversion events with timestamps
- Marketing touchpoints per conversion (channels, campaigns, dates)
- Revenue per conversion
- Time from first touch to conversion
}

Marketing channels:
{List all channels with approximate spend and results}

Business questions to answer:
1. {question_1, e.g., "Should we increase our podcast ad spend?"}
2. {question_2, e.g., "Is our content marketing driving revenue or just traffic?"}
3. {question_3, e.g., "What's the true CAC for enterprise customers?"}

Perform the analysis:

1. MULTI-TOUCH ATTRIBUTION:
   - Apply 4 attribution models to the data:
     * First-touch
     * Last-touch
     * Linear
     * Time-decay
   - Show how credit shifts between channels across models
   - Recommend the best model for our business (and why)

2. CHANNEL VALUE ANALYSIS:
   - Introducing vs. closing channels
   - Assist rate by channel
   - Average touches per conversion by channel
   - Revenue per touch by channel
   - True CAC by channel (using recommended attribution model)

3. PATH ANALYSIS:
   - Most common conversion paths
   - Highest-value conversion paths
   - Path length distribution (how many touches before conversion)
   - Time-to-conversion distribution
   - Paths unique to high-value customers

4. STRATEGIC INSIGHTS:
   - Channels that are overvalued by last-touch (getting too much credit)
   - Channels that are undervalued (doing unrecognized work)
   - Optimal channel mix based on attribution insights
   - Budget reallocation recommendations

5. ANSWERS TO BUSINESS QUESTIONS:
   - Data-driven answer to each question posed
   - Confidence level for each answer
   - Additional data needed for higher confidence

Output Format: Complete attribution analysis with model comparisons, channel valuations, strategic insights, and specific answers to business questions.
```

**Tip:** Even if your data is imperfect (and it always is), running multiple attribution models and comparing them reveals truths. If a channel looks good under every model, invest more. If it only looks good under last-touch, investigate further.

- Industry: {industry}
- Estimated company size: {size}
- Products/services: {their_products}
- Their target audience: {their_audience}

```

**Tip:** Lead with the number leadership cares about most (usually revenue or pipeline). Every subsequent slide should connect back to that number. If a channel does not visibly connect to revenue, explain the pathway or it will look like waste.

---

### Prompt 50: Predictive Marketing Model

```
You are a marketing data scientist. Build a predictive model framework for {brand_name}'s marketing performance.

Historical data available:
{Describe your data: time period, granularity, channels, metrics}

Example data points:
{Provide 6-12 months of monthly data for:
- Marketing spend by channel
